# Reference Implementations

## Hugging Face Discover Tool

The Hugging Face [Discover Tool](https://github.com/huggingface/hf-discover) provides search access to thousands of Skills, ML Applications, and MCP Servers — on Hugging Face - or any other ARD compliant service.

### Hugging Face CLI (`hf`)

`discover` is built into the [Hugging Face CLI](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) (`hf`). To get started:

```bash
# Install the Hugging Face CLI tool:
uv tool install huggingface_hub

# Search for resources to train a model
hf discover search "Fine tune a language model"

# Find MCP Servers to generate an image
hf discover search "Generate an image" --json --kind mcp

# Search other registries
hf discover search "Purchase aeroplane tickets" --registry-url <catalog-url>

# Navigate a federated catalog from a website
hf discover navigate <web-url> "Research biomedical datasets"
```

### REST and MCP API Access

Query the Hugging Face catalog service directly via:

  - The REST API at: `https://huggingface-hf-discover.hf.space/search`
  - MCP at: `https://huggingface-hf-discover.hf.space/mcp`

## GitHub Agent Finder

GitHub's Agent Finder is a discovery service for agentic resources — Skills, tools, and MCP servers — reachable over HTTPS at `https://agentfinder.github.com/api/v1`.

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot can search it directly: add Agent Finder as a remote MCP tool (or as custom instructions), then ask Copilot to find a capability for your task and it returns ranked matches you choose to install. See [Connect GitHub Copilot](connect/github-copilot.md) for the full setup — it uses this same endpoint as its example.

### HTTP API

Call search directly at `POST https://agentfinder.github.com/api/v1/search`. The MCP endpoint is `https://agentfinder.github.com/api/v1/mcp`.

## Cisco AI Catalog

The [AGNTCY Agent Directory](https://dir.agntcy.org) reference implementation of ARD is deployed by the Cisco [AI Catalog](https://ai-catalog.outshift.io).
The catalog can be pulled from [`ai-catalog.outshift.io/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`](https://ai-catalog.outshift.io/.well-known/ai-catalog.json).
It supports secure verification through trust manifests, so clients can validate publisher identity and resource integrity before use.

### 1. Pull the catalog manifest

```bash
curl -sS https://ai-catalog.outshift.io/.well-known/ai-catalog.json | jq '.specVersion, .host.displayName'
```

### 2. Discover A2A cards

```bash
curl -sS 'https://ai-catalog.outshift.io/v1/agents?filter=type%3Dapplication%2Fa2a-agent-card%2Bjson' \
	| jq -r '.results[] | "\(.displayName)\t\(.data.card_data.url // .identifier)"'
```

### 3. Search by card type and extract trust details

```bash
curl -sS 'https://ai-catalog.outshift.io/v1/agents?filter=type%3Dapplication%2Fmcp-server-card%2Bjson' \
	| jq -r '.results[] | {displayName, identity: .trustManifest.identity, identityType: .trustManifest.identityType, cardUrl: .data.card_data.url} | @json'
```

## Ora Directory

The [Ora Directory](https://ora.directory) is an ARD discovery service over products and services that agents use on behalf of users, run by [Ora](https://ora.ai). Ora scans each product for agent-readiness — static checks against its docs, llms.txt, registries, and public APIs, plus live agent runs that attempt to use it end to end — and serves the results over the ARD protocol, alongside the MCP servers, Skills, and OpenAPI specs detected on each product, plus payable x402/MPP HTTP endpoints with per-call pricing, indexed from the public Bazaar registry. Every product entry carries its agent-readiness scorecard as a signed trust attestation, so a client can weigh not only whether a resource matches the task, but whether it has been observed to work for agents.

Ora's publisher manifest at [`ora.ai/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`](https://ora.ai/.well-known/ai-catalog.json) describes Ora's own resources and advertises the registry: its `application/ai-registry+json` entry points at `https://ora.ai/api/ard`, which serves a self-describing descriptor listing the endpoints. The index itself is queried through those endpoints.

### Search and browse

The registry implements the full protocol surface — `POST /search`, `POST /explore`, and `GET /agents` with the spec's `filter` expressions and `orderBy` — and returns `referrals` to peer registries.

```bash
# Find products for a task
curl -sS -X POST https://ora.ai/api/ard/search \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":{"text":"send transactional email"},"pageSize":5}' \
  | jq -r '.results[] | "\(.displayName)\t\(.url)"'

# Browse just the MCP servers in the index
curl -sS -G https://ora.ai/api/ard/agents \
  --data-urlencode "filter=type = 'application/mcp-server-card+json'" \
  --data-urlencode "pageSize=5" \
  | jq -r '.items[].displayName'
```

### Verify a scorecard

Each result's `trustManifest.attestations[]` references the product's agent-readiness scorecard, signed as a detached Ed25519 JWS and verifiable against the JWKS at [`ora.ai/.well-known/jwks.json`](https://ora.ai/.well-known/jwks.json):

```bash
curl -sS https://ora.ai/api/ard/attestation/resend.com \
  | jq '{subject, score, grade, issuer}'
```

### MCP

Ora is also reachable as an MCP server at `https://ora.ai/api/mcp` (streamable HTTP); its `discover_products`, `get_score`, and `search_capabilities` tools query the same index.
